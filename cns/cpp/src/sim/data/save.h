/**
 * Saves a matrix to file, guessing the filetype from the extension.  This
 * will transpose the matrix at save time.  If the filetype cannot be
 * determined, an error will be given.
 *
 * The supported types of files are the same as found in Armadillo:
 *
 *  - CSV (csv_ascii), denoted by .csv, or optionally .txt
 *  - ASCII (raw_ascii), denoted by .txt
 *  - Armadillo ASCII (arma_ascii), also denoted by .txt
 *  - PGM (pgm_binary), denoted by .pgm
 *  - PPM (ppm_binary), denoted by .ppm
 *  - Raw binary (raw_binary), denoted by .bin
 *  - Armadillo binary (arma_binary), denoted by .bin
 *
 * If the file extension is not one of those types, an error will be given.  If
 * the 'fatal' parameter is set to true, an error will cause the program to
 * exit.  If the 'transpose' parameter is set to true, the matrix will be
 * transposed before saving.  Generally, because SIM stores matrices in a
 * column-major format and most datasets are stored on disk as row-major, this
 * parameter should be left at its default value of 'true'.
 *
 * @param filename Name of file to save to.
 * @param matrix Matrix to save into file.
 * @param fatal If an error should be reported as fatal (default false).
 * @param transpose If true, transpose the matrix before saving.
 * @return Boolean value indicating success or failure of save.
