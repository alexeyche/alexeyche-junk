% This code provides values of a, A, and c in the gains a_k=a/(k+1+A)^alpha and 
% c_k = c/(k+1)^.101.  Code assumes Bernoulli +/- 1 distribution for the delta elements. 
%
% Note: if get some error "Subscript indices must be integer values"
% then use "clear" function and redo.

% Specify the dimension, loss function, and i.c. for theta; also alpha for gain 
% selection (alpha = 0.602 is often used as a companion to gamma = 0.101).
