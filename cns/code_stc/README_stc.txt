DESCRIPTION OF THE CODE CONTAINED IN THE ARCHIVE: code_stc.tgz

Demonstrates simple spike-triggered average and spike-triggered covariance
calculations. 

INSTALLATION
============

Unnpack the archive using a compression utility such as WinZip
(or, from the command line in linux: 'tar -xvzf FILENAME.tgz').

Launch matlab and cd into the directory containing the code
(e.g. '/code_stc/').


USE
===

Examine the script 'test_STC.m' for a simple example of STC applied to
a simulated example.

Note: this code is very bare-bones, and lacks important features
necessary for a full STC analysis of neural data (e.g. statistical
tests of eigenvalues, reconstructing the nonlinearity, etc).  It is
intended merely for demonstration/pedagogical purposes, so no need to
cite for use.
