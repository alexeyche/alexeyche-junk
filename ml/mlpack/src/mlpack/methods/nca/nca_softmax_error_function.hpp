 * The "softmax" stochastic neighbor assignment probability function.

 * The actual function is
 *
 * p_ij = (exp(-|| A x_i - A x_j || ^ 2)) /
 *     (sum_{k != i} (exp(-|| A x_i - A x_k || ^ 2)))
 *
 * where x_n represents a point and A is the current scaling matrix.
 *
 * This class is more flexible than the original paper, allowing an arbitrary
 * kernel function to be used, meaning that the Mahalanobis distance is not the
 * only allowed way to run NCA.  However, the Mahalanobis distance is probably
 * the best way to use this.
