// Information about the program itself.
PROGRAM_INFO("Range Search",
    "This program implements range search with a Euclidean distance metric. "
    "For a given query point, a given range, and a given set of reference "
    "points, the program will return all of the reference points with distance "
    "to the query point in the given range.  This is performed for an entire "
    "set of query points. You may specify a separate set of reference and query"
    " points, or only a reference set -- which is then used as both the "
    "reference and query set.  The given range is taken to be inclusive (that "
    "is, points with a distance exactly equal to the minimum and maximum of the"
    " range are included in the results)."
    "\n\n"
    "For example, the following will calculate the points within the range [2, "
    "5] of each point in 'input.csv' and store the distances in 'distances.csv'"
    " and the neighbors in 'neighbors.csv':"
    "\n\n"
    "$ range_search --min=2 --max=5 --reference_file=input.csv\n"
    "  --distances_file=distances.csv --neighbors_file=neighbors.csv"
    "\n\n"
    "The output files are organized such that line i corresponds to the points "
    "found for query point i.  Because sometimes 0 points may be found in the "
    "given range, lines of the output files may be empty.  The points are not "
    "ordered in any specific manner."
    "\n\n"
    "Because the number of points returned for each query point may differ, the"
    " resultant CSV-like files may not be loadable by many programs.  However, "
    "at this time a better way to store this non-square result is not known.  "
    "As a result, any output files will be written as CSVs in this manner, "
    "regardless of the given extension.");
